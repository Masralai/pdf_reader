Objective:
To develop an AI/ML solution that accurately detects and analyzes craters and boulders from OHRC (Orbiter High-Resolution Camera) data, providing detailed and
interactive information for scientific and practical applications.
Key Components:
The solution begins with data preparation and augmentation, where high-resolution OHRC images are collected and manually or semi-automatically annotated to label
craters and boulders. Advanced data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, cutout, mixup, and mosaic are employed to diversify the dataset, enhancing the
model's robustness.
For model training, the annotated and augmented data undergo efficient loading and preprocessing before being used to train a YOLOv8 model. This training leverages
transfer learning from pre-trained models to accelerate the process and improve accuracy. Automated hyperparameter optimization, using tools like Optuna, ensures the
model achieves optimal performance.
During inference and post-processing, the trained model is run on new OHRC data to detect craters and boulders. Advanced post-processing techniques like Soft-NMS (Non-
Maximum Suppression) and Weighted Boxes Fusion (WBF) are applied to refine the detection results, leading to precise object localization.
The solution also includes attribute calculation and shapefile generation. The selenographic positions and diameters of the detected objects are calculated, and detailed
shapefiles are generated, including boundaries and attributes. For interactive visualization, tools like Folium or Dash are used to create dynamic maps.
To ensure efficiency and suitability for deployment, the model undergoes compression techniques such as pruning and quantization to reduce its size and enhance
computational efficiency. The optimized model is then prepared for real-time applications and effective processing.
